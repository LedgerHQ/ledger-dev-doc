Developing Secure Ledger Apps
=============================



Developing applications for Ledger devices (Nano S, X, Blue) is an
intricate process. The security of the user funds relies on the fact
that the application works in a correct and secure manner and that
potential attackers cannot misuse it to extract private data and/or sign
requests which are not authorized by the user. The app should guard
against such attacks because they have a very low entry point -- a
Ledger device attached to a compromised host might be a victim of the
attacker's program sending invalid/non-standard requests to the device.

This guide is meant to be a summary of all important aspects of Ledger
Apps security and it shall be read by developers before developing an
app for Ledger. The guide is divided into multiple sections, each taking
on a different aspect of security.

Development practices
---------------------

Whenever writing a secure Ledger app, the following advice should not be
taken lightly.

Code reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We encourage all written code to be peer-reviewed. Importantly, the
review should have at least:

1. One reviewer proficient in C and knowing C security weaknesses.
2. One reviewer with "hacker's mind" (looking at the code from the
   perspective of an attacker).

Security audits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We encourage third-party security reviews. Note, however, that solid
review takes time and a short review might yield a false sense of
security (especially if the reviewing party does not have an extensive
knowledge of Ledger code specifics).

Developing First App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from reading developer documentation at
https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ we recommend looking at Sia app
https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-sia which provides a nice
starting point for an app, including lots of explanatory comments. A
sample of security-wise overly-paranoid app is
https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-cardano.

Cryptography
------------

This section presents general concepts about cryptography development,
but also guidelines specific to the security model of the Ledger
devices. It gives guidelines to:

* Ensure a potential vulnerability in one application will not cause
  damages to other apps.
* Make sure all the operations that manipulate secrets are approved by
  the user.
* Restrict the use of these secrets by apps.

Own crypto primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**You should never roll your own crypto primitives** (including
encryption/derivation schemes, hashing functions, HMAC, etc.)

Rationale: It is a purpose of BOLOS operating system to perform these in
a secure manner. Importantly, writing your own crypto primitives is
likely to open you to side-channel attacks or other problems. If your
primitive is not supported by BOLOS (e.g., some very new cryptography),
consult with Ledger developers the possibility of including it in the
OS.

Avoid blindly signing data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**You should never allow signing of any attacker-controlled message
unless it has been verified for structural validity. Importantly, you
should never sign a message that might be a hash of transaction.**

Rationale: If you allow an attacker to blindly sign a message, she can
easily supply a hash of a valid transaction. Your signature could then
be used to send an unauthorized transaction.

If you want to sign user-supplied "personal" messages, prefix them with
a fixed string (which shouldn't be a valid transaction prefix). It is
also a good practice to include message length in the text to be signed.
Ledger-app-eth has a good example in function
``handleSignPersonalMessage``. Note that sometimes cryptocurrencies have
a standardized way of signing such personal messages and in that case
you should use the approved scheme.

Warning: If you allow signing untrusted hashes (while displaying a
prompt to the user), be aware that

1. Users do not understand security and could be easily tricked. In
   fact, they will probably click through your prompt without thinking
   unless you give them explicit "Warning: this is a very unusual
   operation. Do not continue unless you know what you are doing"
   warning. They might not listen even then
2. A compromised host might both change hash on the screen and also data
   sent to device. This opens the possibility of users signing something
   they didn't want to.

Restrict Apps to Coin-Specific BIP32 Prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BIP32 paths on which the app can derive keys must be restricted in your
application. The chosen derivation paths must not conflict with existing
paths if the use case differs.

.. warning::
    Ledger will not sign apps whose BIP32 prefixes have not been properly set.

Restricting the derivation path can be done by setting the ``--path`` property
in the app Makefile.

For example, if your application derive keys on the hardened path 44'/60',
specify in your Makefile:

.. code:: makefile

    APP_LOAD_PARAMS += --path "44'/60'"


Derivation can also be restricted to a specific curve using the ``--curve``
property. Supported curves are ``secp256k1``, ``prime256r1`` and ``ed25519``.

Several curves and paths can be configured. For example, if your app must derive
keys on paths 44'/535348', 13' and 17', on curves Ed25519 and prime256r1, the
Makefile should contain:

.. code:: makefile

    APP_LOAD_PARAMS=--curve ed25519 --curve prime256r1 --path "44'/535348'" --path "13'" --path "17'"


Rationale: Setting prefixes is crucial, as it limites the amount of damages
an attacker can do if he manages to compromise an application. If a
vulnerability is exploited on a poorly written of backdoored application, an
attacker should not be able to exploit it to extract private keys from other
apps, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum keys.

.. warning::

    If your application derives keys on the hardened path 44'/60' then the chainID parameter must be different from 0 or 1.
    This is necessary to avoid replaying transactions broadcoast on Ethereum-like chains on Ethereum.
    As a general recommendation, and to ensure a good level of privacy for the end user, we recommend to always use the correct coin  type in the derivation path as defined in slip44 (https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)


Signing/disclosing keys without user approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    You must always require user approval for signing transactions/messages.

Rationale: If you do not require user consent for signing important
data, an attacker can use your device as a signing black box and sign
whatever it wants.

.. note::

    You might also consider approvals for extracting public keys, as
    some users might want extended privacy.
    
    1. They might not want to reveal their *root/account* public key, only
       address keys
    2. They might not want to reveal address public key until it is required.
       (Some cryptocurrencies use addresses that are hash of public keys. It
       is therefore enough to send the address to the host).
    
    Note that there is a trade-off between privacy and usability here. If
    you want privacy, it would require a user interaction every time they
    want to use Ledger device, as opposed to only interaction while signing
    transactions. The behaviour could also be manually set in the application
    options.

Private Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**You should minimize the code that works with private (ECDSA, RSA, etc.) or
secret (HMAC, AES, etc.) keys.** Importantly, you should always **clear the
memory** after you use these keys. That includes key data and key objects.

Leaving parts of private or secret keys lying around in memory is not a
security issue on its own because there is no easy way to extract the content
of RAM on the chip. If a key is left in RAM by an app, another app will not be
able to access it.

However, if the key has not been properly erased, a security issue could lead
to the leak of this key, even if it is not used anymore. An attacker able to
read arbitrary memory from the app, or execute arbitrary code, will be able
to read the content of the stack segment, hence the parts of the key which have
not been erased.

A common (and wrong) way of doing this:

.. code:: c

    uint8_t privateKeyData[64];
    cx_ecfp_private_key_t privateKey;

    os_perso_derive_node_bip32(
        tmpCtx.transactionContext.curve, tmpCtx.transactionContext.bip32Path,
        tmpCtx.transactionContext.pathLength, privateKeyData,
        NULL);
    cx_ecfp_init_private_key(tmpCtx.transactionContext.curve, privateKeyData,
                             32, &privateKey);
    explicit_bzero(privateKeyData, sizeof(privateKeyData));

    // (later, after privateKey is not needed)
    explicit_bzero(&privateKey, sizeof(privateKey));

In the happy path, the previous code will correctly clean the memory
once the private key is initialized. Note, however, that this code
**fails to protect private key in case some system call throws (for
example cx_ecfp_init_private_key)**. Correct code should wrap the
clearing in ``BEGIN_TRY { TRY { ... } FINALLY { explicit_bzero() } END_TRY;``.

Applications where such issues were fixed include
`the ARK app <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ark/commit/e84a4dc0c422f7ade586c831cbab56cb15c64df1>`_
and `the Solana app <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-solana/pull/5/files>`_.

Be Wary of Untrusted Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some cryptocurrencies do not have *explicit* fee encoded in the
transaction. In such cases, the app cannot rely on fee value sent from
the host. Instead, it should receive previous UTxOs and check their
output amounts. Note that this usually needs to be done in a separate
step due to memory constraints. Check with BTC/Cardano app design for
this.

Properly protect data you wish to cache on the host computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes your app needs to compute over more data than it can fit
inside memory. Taking an example from the previous section, it might not
be easy to store all UTxOs in memory of Ledger. As such, you might break
computation into multiple steps and, for example, verify each UTxO
separately and let the host computer to cache a "certified summary". If
you do this, be aware that

1. If the information you want the host to cache is public, you still
   need to attach a signature to it so that the host cannot send some
   other value later. This could be done with standard HMAC digest. We
   would recommend using a temporary (per session) key for this --
   having a per-session HMAC allows you to truncate the digest size
   (e.g., you don't need to have HMAC which withstands years of
   brute-force attack. Instead, you can balance the digest size against
   some reasonable upper bound on how long the session lives (e.g., one
   month should be enough)).

2. If the information is not public, you need to both encrypt and
   provide a signature. Notably, it is not enough to "scramble" the data
   by XORing with a random key as this would still allow the attacker to
   tamper with the values. (Or even break the scrambling if you re-use
   the same key).

   Instead:

   -  Encrypt the information with a sufficiently strong cipher
   -  Provide a digest to avoid tampering with the value

Do not allow the host to freely manipulate with key-pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some cryptocurrencies (notably Monero) need to perform an extensive
calculation with *(public, private)* key-pair spread over multiple APDU
exchanges. If you need to do the same, **do not** allow the attacker to
step out of the protocol. Notably, allowing the attacker to freely
perform key manipulation (e.g., group multiplications, exponentiations,
etc.) could undermine your app security **even if the private key never
leaves the device**. In general, keep an explicit protocol state machine
during the computation. Also, consult with cryptography experts to check
for implications if you misstep from the protocol.

C is your enemy
---------------

Know your C compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ledger apps are written in C. Unlike typical embedded project, the goal
here is to write for a single platform with a single compiler.

The current supported compiler is clang, and it supports newest language
features (up to C11). This is useful for both development and security.
You should really learn about the new features and use them extensively
as they might help you writing more secure code.

A random collection of useful features: intermingled declarations and code,
support of ``_Generic``, ``_Static_assert``, ``__builtin_types_compatible_p``,
``__typeof`` (very useful for safer versions of macros), etc.

Use safe macro constructs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C is a minefield of problems related to pointers. You can alleviate some
of the problems with good macros. However, beware of when they can
fail. For example, take the following code:

.. code:: c

    #define ARRAY_LEN(a) sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0])

Apart from the "obvious" problem of ARRAY\_LEN macro being written
without external parenthesis, making code such as

.. code:: c

    (uint8_t) ARRAY_LEN(x)

compile to what is understood by the compiler as

.. code:: c

    (uint8_t) sizeof(x) / sizeof(x[0])

there is an important problem with this macro. If used in the function
like this

.. code:: c

    void fn(int x[10]) {
        int len = ARRAY_LEN(x)
    }

The result is unexpectedly len=1. The reason is that ``int x[10]`` in
the function header is silently converted into ``int* x`` and the length
is therefore ``sizeof(ptr) / sizeof(int)`` which is indeed 1 on the
platform. You can read more about the problem and how to define a safe
version in
http://zubplot.blogspot.com/2015/01/gcc-is-wonderful-better-arraysize-macro.html
which explains a patch to the Linux kernel to improve safety of its
ARRAY\_SIZE macro.

Note that similar problems exist, if x is a pointer, with:

.. code:: c

    memset(x, 0, sizeof(x))

In general, if writing macros, try to write them in a way that they will
fail if they get a pointer instead of struct/array.

Buffer overflows/underflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buffer overflows and underflows are perhaps the biggest source of
security vulnerabilities in C code. The following example shows a buffer
overflow in (a past version) of one Ledger app.

.. code:: c

    #define MAX_RAW_TX 200
    ...
    struct tmpCtx {
        ...
        uint8_t rawTx[MAX_RAW_TX];
    } transactionContext_t;

    const uint8_t PREFIX[] = {0x00, 0x01, 0x02 ... } // coin-specific signing prefix

    void handleSign(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t *workBuffer,
                    uint16_t dataLength, volatile unsigned int *flags,
                    volatile unsigned int *tx) {
        ... // (no dataLength validation, we can get up to 255 from APDU)
        // Note: we can pass this line with dataLength > 200
        if (parseTx(workBuffer, dataLength, &txContent) != USTREAM_FINISHED) {
            THROW(0x6A80);
        }
        ...
        memmove(tmpCtx.rawTx, PREFIX, sizeof(PREFIX));
        
        // Here is the vulnerability. There should be a check of
        // if (!(dataLength + sizeof(SIGN_PREFIX) < MAX_RAW_TX)) THROW(...)
        memmove(tmpCtx.transactionContext.rawTx + sizeof(SIGN_PREFIX), workBuffer, dataLength);
    }

In general, there is only a single remedy for buffer overflows -
**always check for available buffer space before writing to memory**.
The best is to not rely on some specific buffer size but instead rely on
sizeof operator. If using sizeof, however, be very careful - if you
ever pass a buffer to a function, you are losing its size!

.. code:: c

    uint8_t a[100];
     
    main() {
     sizeof(a); // 100
     f(a);
     g(a);
    }
     
    void f(uint8_t* x) {
      sizeof(x); // 4 
    } 
     
    void g(uint8_t oops[100]) {
      sizeof(oops); // 4
    }

For the extra safery, consider using a SIZEOF macro defined similarly to
https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-cardano/blob/f578c903c19288495a359a2bc909b39c33ee69ca/src/utils.h#L27

Be also wary of constructs like

.. code:: c

    memset(displayAddress, 0, sizeof(fullAddress));
    memmove((void *)displayAddress, tmpCtx.address, 5);
    memmove((void *)(displayAddress + 5), "...", 3);
    memmove((void *)(displayAddress + 8), tmpCtx.address + addressLength - 4, 4);

There are several problematic aspects of such code. Apart from
truncating important values (see next sections), this code makes a lot
of assumptions. For example, if addressLength < 4 (maybe some previous
function returns addressLength=0 instead of an error) we get buffer
underflow and copy up to 4 bytes of other memory and display it to the
user. Or a programmer decides to shorten definition of fullAddress below
13 and we would overwrite memory after the buffer. Finally, this code
uses explicit indexes (e.g., 5, 8=5+3). A better trick would be to have
a safe helper macro:

.. code:: c

    #define APPEND(ptr, end, from, len) \
      do { \
        if (ptr + len >= end || len < 0) THROW(); // not enough space \
        memcpy(ptr, from, len); \
        ptr += len; \
      } while(0)
     
    char* ptr_begin = displayAddress;
    char* ptr_end = displayAddress + sizeof(displayAddress); // points behind buffer
    APPEND(ptr_begin, ptr_end, tmpCtx.address, 5); // we should also assert addressLength>5
    APPEND(ptr_begin, ptr_end, "...", 3); // Note, we still have explicit size here
    APPEND(ptr_begin, ptr_end, tmpCtx.address - 4, 4); // Note: another assert

Finally, you can use SPRINTF macro from
``sdk/include/os_io_seproxyhal.h`` but be aware that the definition is

.. code:: c

    #define SPRINTF(strbuf, ...) snprintf(strbuf, sizeof(strbuf), __VA_ARGS__)

so the above warning about passing pointers instead of arrays applies to
it.

Integer overflows/underflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer overflows go hand in hand with buffer overflows. In fact, they
can cause serious buffer overflows. Consider following code where a
numeric underflow causes buffer overflow of 64kB!

.. code:: c

    void handleSign(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t *workBuffer,
                    uint16_t dataLength, volatile unsigned int *flags,
                    volatile unsigned int *tx)
    {
        uint32_t i;
     
        // here we don't check if dataLength > 0 so we might be reading behind the buffer
        tmpCtx.transactionContext.pathLength = workBuffer[0];
        if ((tmpCtx.transactionContext.pathLength < 0x01) ||
            (tmpCtx.transactionContext.pathLength > MAX_BIP32_PATH))
        {
            PRINTF("Invalid path\n");
            THROW(0x6a80);
        }
        workBuffer++;
        dataLength--;
        for (i = 0; i < tmpCtx.transactionContext.pathLength; i++)
        {
            tmpCtx.transactionContext.bip32Path[i] =
                (workBuffer[0] << 24) | (workBuffer[1] << 16) |
                (workBuffer[2] << 8) | (workBuffer[3]);
            workBuffer += 4;
            // here we again blindly assume dataLength >= 4
            dataLength -= 4;
        }
     
        initTxContext(&txProcessingCtx, &sha256, &dataSha256, &txContent, N_storage.dataAllowed);
        // if we sent APDU with dataLength=0 at the beginning, we would end up with dataLength ~ 64kB here
        txResult = parseTx(&txProcessingCtx, workBuffer, dataLength);
        ...
    }

As a general rule, be very careful about variables which might overflow
or underflow. If possible, use bigger types that can accommodate the
arithmetic operations you need to perform. For buffer sizes, prefer
unsigned types -- that way, you can easily check both overflow and
underflow in one go, i.e.

.. code:: c

    void f(uint8_t* buf, size_t bufSize) { // size_t is unsigned
      if (bufSize < REASONABLE_SIZE) THROW(); // guards both against underflow and overflow!
    }

Data Truncation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Speaking of safely formatting data, be wary of truncated values.
Importantly, make sure you do not truncate any important data when
displaying on the Ledger screen.

Example 1: Truncating tx hash from
"f6954eb23ecd1d64c782e6d6c32fad2876003ae92986606585ae7187470d5e04" to
"f695...5e04" might look nice for the users but this effectively reduces
the security of hash and an attacker can now easily try to create a hash
collision. Instead, prefer scrolling/paging of long such important
values.

Example 2: Raise errors instead of truncation

.. code:: c

    int tmp[10]; // max 10 digits, right?
     
    uint32_t amount = 1987654321
    SPRINTF(tmp, "%d", amount) // at least we won't get buffer overflow here ...
    display(tmp) // but we display an empty screen!
     
    // but it could be worse
    // with bad custom formatting function we could get
    format_amount(tmp, SIZEOF(tmp), amount) // "198765432" or "987654321"

Stack overflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You application has only a limited size (about ~700B) of stack. That is
one of the reasons why stack cookies are not supported yet on the platform.

Given the memory constraints, BOLOS OS does not have memory mapping which
would protect from stack overflow errors. As a result, it is very easy to
consume more stack space and overwrite the end of your data.

Recommendation:

Enable ``DEFINES += HAVE_BOLOS_APP_STACK_CANARY`` in your Makefile. This
will help you detect stack overflows during app development. If overflow
is detected, the app will reboot the device. Note that the overflow check
happens only on the next I/O. This means that the protection is not instant
and an attacker might avoid the canary check: this option is not a security
feature, and has been added to analyze the stack usage during testing
process.

Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not clear sensitive data with for-loops or other techniques. Do not
user ``memset`` or ``bzero`` to clear sensitive data: it could be
optimized and removed by the compiler.

Recommendation: Use ``explicit_bzero`` which guarantees that the
compiler will not remove the erasure. (See
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Insecure\_Compiler\_Optimization for an
example of how things could go wrong.)

Business logic problems
-----------------------

Swallowing errors & half-updated states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It goes without saying that you should check return value of functions
for any errors. Fortunately, BOLOS throws an error if something goes
wrong and you might want to do the same instead of relying on error
codes.

There is, however, a more indirect problem. Some BOLOS apps silently
catch exceptions in the main event loop without erasing app memory. This
could lead into a following insidious bug:

.. code:: c

    uint16_t totalSize;
    uint8_t totalBuf[1000];
     
    void signTx(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t* data, uint16_t dataSize) {
      if (p1 == P1_INIT) {
        totalSize = 0;
      }

      uint8_t* ptr = totalBuf[totalSize];
      totalSize += dataSize;
      if (totalSize > SIZEOF(totalBuf)) THROW(ERR);
      memcpy(ptr, data, dataSize);
     
      if (p2 == P2_CONTINUE) {
        THROW(0x9000); // early exit with success
      }
      do_something();
    }

An attacker might do

1. SignTx(INIT, 100 bytes of data) // OK

2. SignTx(CONTINUE, 100 bytes of data) // OK

...

10. SignTx(CONTINUE, 100 bytes of data) // OK

11. SignTx(CONTINUE, 100 bytes of data) // throws

…

5. SignTx(CONTINUE, 100 bytes of data) // throws

6. SignTx(CONTINUE, 100 bytes of data) **// writes to data[-64..36]**

The problem here is that the app state is not updated in a
"transactional" manner and attacker exploits this.

Recommendations: Try to not affect global state before you throw. Many
times you can use a scratch memory to assemble result and only then do
``memmove`` to write the result. Even better, wipe memory/reboot device
on exceptions to destroy any half-updated app states.

Too lenient parsing of transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might happen that your transaction parsing is too lenient.
Importantly, this might cause problems if the transaction serialization
spec is ambiguous and different clients might interpret it differently.
For example, if a field might be repeated one parser might take the
first value while another one a second. In general, lenient tx
serialization spec should not happen (and if so, the cryptocurrency has
bigger concerns than Ledger wallet).

However, even if the network nodes are strict with the serialization
checking, you should not slack off on your part. Any ambiguity in
parsing adds an attacker a leverage point once it finds some other
vulnerability.

Recommendation: Be as strict as possible with transaction parsing.
Accept only fields which are in normalized form. If possible, avoid
repeated fields and accept fields only in a pre-described order.

Note: you can even go further and do not parse transaction on the device
at all. Instead, just send the data in a custom format and let both the
app and host serialize the transaction on their own with the app
revealing (and signing) only the serialized hash. This way you can avoid
bugs in parsing code and be sure both the host wallet and the app agree
perfectly on the content of the transaction.

Protect Against "Instruction Change" Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ledger applications live on a secure chip which is very limited in terms
of its memory and communication channel. This brings in an interesting
problem -- the application might not be able to perform all its work in
a single request. Instead, the work will need to be spread over multiple
requests. Whenever this happens, the application needs to be protected
against attacker mixing multiple non-related (or even related) requests.

If your application contains at least one instruction which works over
multiple APDU exchanges (e.g., having ``P1_INIT/P1_CONTINUE`` flag in
the standard application "terminology"), you have to protect it from
interference. Common attack scenarios:

Example: Two multi-APDU instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you have SignTx and SignMessage, both sharing the same global
``hash`` variable, both instructions working over multiple APDU
exchanges.The attacker might now call

1. SignMessage(INIT)
2. SignTx(INIT)
3. SignMessage(CONTINUE) with data (no finish yet)
4. SignTx(CONTINUE) with data (finish)

At this point, the global memory might be in an inconsistent state (for
example, the SignTx hash does contain a different hash than it should
be). This might lead to an easy attack.

Example: Single multi-APDU instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even if you have only a single instruction with multiple APDU exchanges,
an attacker might gain some leverage. Let's say you have roughly

.. code:: c

Example: "Self"-attack on a single multi-APDU instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't even need two instructions to perform a variation of the
attack. Suppose your code goes along these lines

.. code:: c

    void signTx () {
      if (p1 == P1_INIT) {
        initialize_half_of_my_state()
        if (some_bad_input) THROW(error)
        initialize_rest_of_the_state
      } else {
        // do something
      }
    }

Assuming that you do not reset state on exceptions, this might happen

1. signTx(INIT, valid data)
2. signTx(CONTINUE, valid data)
3. signTx(INIT, data which throws)
4. signTx(CONTINUE, more data)

An attacker now managed to reset half of your state (maybe tx length)
but not the rest of it (maybe tx hash) which might allow it to attack
your code.

Obviously, there are many variations of this basic scheme and an utmost
care needs to be taken here. The recommendation here is:

1. Do not allow mixing of instructions
2. Within instruction, keep an explicit state machine of what is allowed
   to happen next)
3. Clear memory on exceptions

Use explicit state machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a host is required to perform certain actions in a specific
order, be sure to explicitly track the state and verify that the next
step is consistent. Good examples of what might need to be checked

1. If host claims some number of tx inputs/outputs, make sure you
   receive exactly that amount, not more and not less
2. If the host needs to send multiple transaction inputs and outputs and
   you have to process inputs before outputs, make sure the host cannot
   send additional input after it received an output.
3. Check that once you finished an action (signing), the attacker cannot
   resume with additional data (which might be empty). This is
   important, because usually signing "closes" some hash contexts (or
   destroy some other data) and re-running
   ``SignTx(CONTINUE, empty data)`` might, therefore, yield either crash
   or produce a signature of some different data. In general, after
   finishing a request you should wipe the context variable
4. If you do not reset UI after sending APDU (for example, because you
   displayed an address and now you are waiting for another APDU
   containing tx amount), make sure your button handlers fire just once
   -- a user might press the buttons multiple times. A general
   recommendation would be to always reset UI with APDU response.
   Additionally, you can guard your app against itself (and against bad
   SDK) with tracking whether it should be in IO/UI phase and assert on
   it in APDU/UI handlers.

An (somewhat contrived) example of problematic button handlers

.. code:: c

    void handle_sign_message(...) {
      ... // validations
      if (!is_last_apdu) {
        cx_hash(CX_CONTINUE, ctx->hash, data); 
      else {
        memcpy(ctx->last_part, data);
        flags *= IO_ASYNCH;
        display_tx_prompt();
      }
    }
     
    unsigned int io_seproxyhal_touch_tx_ok() {
      // for some reason we modify ctx state here
      cx_hash(CX_LAST, ctx->last_part);
      sign(ctx->last_part);
      // now do io_exchange

      // Warning: this might throw (host might do something weird with USB)
      // -> user will press the button second time
      // -> we do another round of cx_hash -> efficiently signing
      io_exchange(....);
      // now reset UI
      ui_idle(); // <-- this line resets button callback
    }

A fully resilient solution would be

.. code:: c

    void display_tx_prompt() {
       tx_prompt_handled = false;
       ...
    }
     
    unsigned int io_seproxyhal_touch_tx_ok() {
      assert(!tx_prompt_handled);
      tx_prompt_handled = true;
      ...
    }
     
    unsigned int io_seproxyhal_touch_tx_cancel() {
      assert(!tx_prompt_handled);
      tx_prompt_handled = true;
      ...
    }

But such a solution is needed only if tx\_ok or tx\_cancel modify
context/global variables before calling ui\_idle(). (As a side note, if
your\_\_ok()/\_\_cancel() handler both 1) do not check whether the
memory is cleared, but 2) clear the memory inside the handler; make sure
that memclear happens after calling ui\_idle()).

Note: If not guarded properly, an attacker might try a following line of
attack:

1. Send transaction which is not what user wanted
2. User realizes that the transaction is wrong and presses reject
3. Attacker hogs ``io_exchange`` (presumably by doing some bad things to
   USB communication)
4. User tries again a few more times, thinks that the UI is broken and
   the app hanged. The callbacks are fired again and again but
   ``io_exchange`` still throws
5. At this point in time, a desperate user might click on "confirm"
   button to unblock the UI. If an attacker can guess this time, she can
   un-hog USB and receive confirm callback
